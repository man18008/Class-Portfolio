      What did I do since the last meeting?
<p></p>This week has been very difficult! However. I was able to create an object to read to the server in my challenge 2 project. This will be critical for moving forward. I also created a password protection feature for my website app!!

<p></p>2. What am I going to do next?

<p></p>Next I am going to finish creating a way to give the user a form of data from html to a database.
</div><div class="col-sm-4">
<p></p>3.What are my blockers?

<p></p>Firebase seems to be the wrong option for me. I am going to explore other options. However I enjoyed learning more about firebase and I look forward to using it in a more relevant project!!
