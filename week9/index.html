      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
      Cookies are small files saved in the browser. They are used to save "state" Cookies can only be read from the same domain that created them. Create a cookie by assigning it a string with a key/value pair. 
      </p>

      <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
      <p>
        The setTimeout() method will call another method at some future time. The return value is an id for the
        timer and can be used to cancel the timer with the clearTimeout() method.
        The setInterval() method is like setTimeout, but will repeat until a corresponding clearInterval() method is
        called.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Web Storage</h3>        
      <p>The Web Storage API holds site related key/value pairs. It is similar to cookies storage, but easier to use
        with a greater capacity and not transferred over http calls.
        Web Storage is accessed through the localStorage object with several methods.</p>
