               When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the 
                    constraints set by the application. </p> <p> This is called form validation. </p> <p>
                    Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the 
                    server is called server-side validation. </p> <p>In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.
