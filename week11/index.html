            <p>
              typeof will find out the type of a value (ie if it's boolean, string, number, object)
            </p>
            <p>
              parseInt converts a string back into a number. It needs a parameter of how many numbers you want it to show.
            (Chapter 2)
            </p>
            <p>
              In an array, array.length - 1 will give you the value of the last item in the array. You have to subtract
            one because the array starts at 0.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sets do not have index notation for inspecting individual entries, so you can't find the value of the first
            element in a set.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also assign a function to a variable like this: const nameOfVariable = function nameOfFunction()
            {console.log ('Message');}
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
